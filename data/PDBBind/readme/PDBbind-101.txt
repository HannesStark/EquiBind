PART I. Introduction to the PDBbind database 

The PDBbind database aims at building a comprehensive collection of 
experimentally measured binding affinity data for all types of biomolecular
complexes deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). It provides an essential 
linkage between energetic and structural information of those complexes, which 
is helpful for various studies relevant to molecular recognition.

A proto-type of the PDBbind database was developed in Prof. Shaomeng Wang's 
group at the University of Michigan, which was first published in 2004. This 
database has been maintained by Prof. Renxiao Wang's group at the Shanghai 
Institute of Organic Chemistry (Chinese Academy of Sciences) since 2006. 
It is now maintained by Prof. Renxiao Wang's group at Fudan University in 
China.  

The PDBbind database has been updated on an annual base to keep up with the 
growth of the Protein Data Bank. It can be assessed at the web portal at 
http://www.pdbbind-cn.org/, where the registered users can download this 
data package.  

This release contains PDBbind version 2020, which is based on the contents of 
PDB officially released by Jan 1st, 2020. This release provides binding data of 
a total of 23496 biomolecular complexes, including protein-ligand (19443), 
nucleic acid-ligand (149), protein-nucleic acid (1052), and protein-protein 
complexes (2852). All binding data were curated by ourselves from ~40500 
original references.

PART III. About the processed structures of protein-ligand complexes

This data package also includes processed, "clean" structural files for ALL 
19443 protein-small ligand complexes in the "general set". These structural 
files can be readily utilized by most molecular modeling software. An index 
of these complexes, i.e. "INDEX_structure.2020", can be found under the 
"index" directory. 

Note: we provide processed structural files only for the complexes formed 
by proteins and small-molecule ligands. Other types of complexes, e.g. 
protein-protein or protein-nucleic acid complexes, are not available by now.
Nevertheless, we do plan to add other types of complexes once we have more 
human power.  

Each complex is processed by the following methods:

(1) Each complex is saved in a subdirectory named after its PDB code:

    e.g. 1bxo/

    It is split into a protein molecule saved in the PDB format:

    e.g. 1bxo_protein.pdb

    and a ligand molecule saved in the Tripos Mol2 format and the MDL SDF 
    format:

    e.g. 1bxo_ligand.mol2 & 1bxo_ligand.sdf

    For convenience in display or analysis, another PDB file includes only 
    the binding pocket, i.e. all residues within 10A from the ligand. 

    e.g. 1bxo_pocket.pdb

    When adding hydrogen atoms to the protein and the ligand, a simple 
    protonation scheme under the neutral pH condition are applied: 
    On the protein side, Asp, Glu, and His residues are deprotonated; while 
    Lys and Arg residues are protonated; on the ligand side, carboxylic, 
    sulfonic, and phosphoric acid groups are deprotonated; while aliphatic 
    amine groups, guanidine and amidine groups are protonated.

    *Importantly*, the ligand molecule in the Mol2 format is presented in 
    the protonation form as described above; but the ligand molecule in the 
    SDF format is presented in its neutral form (e.g.-COOH). This is a new
    feature starting from PDBbind version 2020, which aims at providing more 
    options. The users should decide which form to use for their own study. 

(2) The protein molecule normally contains a complete "biological unit". 
    Exceptions are made only if the biological unit is too large (>3000 
    residues). In such cases, only the peptide chains that are relevant to 
    ligand binding (within 10A from the ligand) are kept. Structure of the 
    biological unit of each complex was also downloaded from PDB without 
    further modifications. Note that a small number of biological units given 
    by PDB are actually problematic, but to be consistent with PDB, we did 
    not attempt to fix them (i.e. not to confuse the users).  

(3) Both the protein and the ligand keep their original coordinates from PDB. 
    Hydrogen atoms are added to both molecules using stardard bond lengths 
    and bond angles. Coordinates of all atoms, including non-hydrogen atoms 
    and hydrogen atoms, have NOT been further optimized so that they remain 
    the same as those in the original PDB files. 

(4) For each protein molecule, all of the atoms are re-numbered continuously 
    starting from 1 because some molecular modeling softwares require so. 
    But the residue numbers and chain labels remain the same as those in 
    the original PDB files. Metal ions and water molecules are saved with 
    the protein molecule in the "HETATM" section. 

(5) The chemical structure of each ligand molecule was interpreted with a 
    special computer program based on the original PDB file. It was then 
    examined manually to correct atom/bond types if necessary. Gasteiger-Huckel
    partial charges are assigned on each ligand molecule and saved in the
    Mol2-format file.  

Note that if the ligand molecule in a complex is a peptide, technically it 
could be classified as a protein-ligand or a protein-protein complex. 
By our definition, a valid protein-protein complex should consist of at 
least two different protein molecules, each of which should have at least 
20 residues. If either molecule is a peptide shorter than 20 residues, it 
is classified as a protein-ligand complex.

PART IV. Description of the "refined set"

As an additional value of PDBbind, some protein-ligand complexes are selected 
to form a special data set, namely the "refined set". This special set serves 
as a more solid basis for docking/scoring studies. It is compiled by removing 
the protein-ligand complexes in the general set with obvious problems in 3D 
structure, binding data, or other aspects. 

A number of filtering rules are applied to sample selection. Complexes of the 
following types are NOT accepted into the "refined set":

(1) Concerns on the quality of structures  

    (a) It is not a crystal structure, resolution>2.5A, or R-factor>0.250.
    (b) The ligand is bound to the protein through a covalent bond.
    (c) It is a ternary complex, i.e. multiple ligands binding at the same site.
    (d) Obvious steric clash (<2.0A) exist between ligand and protein.
    (e) Ratio of the buried solvent-accessible surface of the ligand <15%.
    (f) Non-standard residues are in direct contact with the ligand, or there
        are missing fragments on the backbone or sidechain of any pocket
        residue.
    (g) The ligand molecule contains atom of uncommon element, such as B, Be, 
        Si, or metal.
    (i) There is missing fragment on the ligand structure. 
    (h) Molecular weight of the ligand >1000 if it is a regular organic 
        molecule, or it contains >=10 residues if it is a peptide or peptide 
        mimic.

(2) Concerns on the quality of binding data

    (a) The binding data are IC50 values rather than Kd and Ki values.
    (b) The binding data are not exact values, e.g. Kd~1pM, Ki<10uM.
    (c) The binding data fall out of the desired range, i.e. logKa<2.00 
        (Kd>10mM) or logKa>=12.00 (Kd<=1pM).
    (d) The protein used in binding assay does not match the one in crystal
        structure, e.g. of different subtypes, mutants, or species.
    (e) The ligand used in binding assay does not match the one in crystal
        structure, e.g. in different forms or having missing fragments. 
    (f) The protein binds with two ligand molecules at two binding sites, 
        resulting in two binding constants (i.e. Kd1 and Kd2) significantly 
        different (>10 folds).

Details of the latest set of rules are described in the following publication: 
Liu,Z.H. et al. Acc.Chem.Res. 2017, 50, 302-309.

The "refined set" in PDBbind v.2020 consists of 5316 selected protein-ligand 
complexes. 

*Note*: Although compiled through a set of complex filters, the "refined set" 
should not be interpreted as a real high-quality data set because various 
problems may still remain in the selected complexes. The refined set can be 
used as an easy starting point for most researchers. If necessary, other 
researchers are welcome to apply even more strigent rules to compile their own 
data sets based on what are available from PDBbind. 

################################################################################

Part V. Description of the "core set"

Previous releases of PDBbind (up to v.2016) included another speical data set
called the "core set". This data set is strictly a subset selected from the 
"refined set". The "core set" is compiled as a relatively small set of 
high-quality protein-ligand complexes with remarkable diversity in structure 
as well as binding data. It can serve as a benchmark data set for validating 
docking/scoring methods. In particular, the "core set" has been the primary 
test set in the popular Comparative Assessment of Scoring Functions (CASF) 
benchmark developed by our group. 

Because the "core set" is employed primarily in our CASF benchmark, it is NOT 
updated on an annual base as the PDBbind database itself. Besides, the 
"core set" is a lot more than a list of protein-ligand complexes. A huge amount
of derivative data need to be generated. Therefore, starting from PDBbind
v.2017, we have decided to isolate the core set from the PDBbind data package.
The users can download the CASF data package to obtain the core set. The 
complete CASF data package is available for downloading at our PDBbind-CN 
web site at http://www.pdbbind-cn.org/casf.asp.

For your information, the latest available "core set" is v.2016, which is 
compiled based on the contents of PDBbind v.2016. This data set is composed 
of 285 protein-ligand complexes in 57 clusters. It has been employed in our 
CASF-2016 benchmark. The methods for compiling this data set can be found in 
the following publication: 

Su,M.Y. et al. J.Chem.Inf.Model, 2019, 59, 895-913. (CASF-2016)
